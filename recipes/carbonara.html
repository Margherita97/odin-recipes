    <h2 class="description">About carbonara</h2>
    <p><strong>Carbonara</strong> is a typical <em>Italian</em> dish, which has become <em>worldwide</em> famous. Its origins go back to the <strong>19th century</strong>. Made up of <strong>simple and fresh</strong> ingredients, this recipe will <em>conquer</em> every belly!</p>
    <p>This recipe uses the most classic pasta shape: <em>spaghetti</em>. However, feel free to use the shape that you prefer. Carbonara goes well also with rigatoni and paccheri. Also, most Italians would start <em>crying</em> if you use bacon instead of <strong>guanciale</strong>, but we give you permission to replace the latter in case of necessity.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients (4 servings):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Spaghetti</strong> 320 g</li>
        <li><strong>Yolks</strong> 4</li>

        <li><strong>Guanciale</strong> 200 g</li>
        <li><strong>Parmigiano Reggiano</strong> 30 g</li>
        <li><strong>Black pepper</strong> 20 g</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong><em>As finisher:</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pecorino cheese</strong> 20 g</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the water for pasta.</li>

        <li>When the water il boiling, salt it and add the pasta.</li>
        <li>While the pasta cooks, prepare the egg and cheese cream: in a bowl put the 4 yolks, the egg, the pecorino and the parmigiano. Add some salt (not too much as the cheese and guanciale already add sapidity to the dish) and enough pepper. Then mix quickly with a fork or a hand whisk, until it becomes creamy.</li>
        <li>Drain the pasta 2/3 minutes before their reach the <em>"al dente"</em> point. While draining the pasta, keep some pasta water to the side, don't throw it all.</li>
        <li>Put the spaghetti into the pot, add the pasta water, and start mixing them vigorously. After a while, add the guanciale (keep some of it to put on the top as decoration), and finally, while keeping on stirring, the creamy egg and cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Your carbonara is ready! Serve it and finish it by sprinkling some guanciale and pecorino on top. <strong>Enjoy!</strong></li>
